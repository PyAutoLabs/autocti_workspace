"""
Run the workspace smoke test suite: the scripts listed in `smoke_tests.txt`.

Nothing about discovery, exclusion, environment resolution, per-script timeouts
or reporting is implemented here. This is a thin shim over PyAutoHands'
`autohands/run_python.py` — the same entry point PyAutoHeart's
workspace-validation uses — so the PR gate and the validation runner cannot
drift apart.

It is deliberately a shim and not a copy. The sibling repos each carried a
198-line copy of that machinery, and every fix to it — the env-resolver fork
(PyAutoHands#185), the per-script timeout and process-group kill
(PyAutoHands#226/#227), the jupyter guard — had to be swept across all of them
by hand. This file holds no logic, so it needs none of those sweeps. It mirrors
`autocti_workspace_test/.github/scripts/run_smoke.py`; keep the two in step.

What the shared runner provides:

  * the allowlist in `smoke_tests.txt`, run in that file's own order
  * per-script env from `config/build/profile_smoke.yaml`, via the one resolver
  * the `BUILD_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT` cap and the process-group kill on expiry
  * a structured JSON report, and a non-zero exit when anything failed

`--report-dir` is REQUIRED, not cosmetic. run_python.py only propagates failures
(`sys.exit(1)`) when a report was built; without it the suite runs to completion
and always exits 0 — a vacuously green gate.
